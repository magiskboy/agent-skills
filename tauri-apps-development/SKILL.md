# Tauri Apps Development

Conventions and workflows for building Tauri v2 desktop apps (React + TypeScript
frontend, Rust backend in `src-tauri/`). This file is an index — read the linked
reference files for the actual rules and patterns, and see `assets/` for complete
example source files to imitate.

> **Read [references/workflow-common-rules.md](references/workflow-common-rules.md)
> first.** It holds the rules that apply to every task: communication,
> code quality, mandatory verification, and the non-negotiable IPC rules.

## Workflows — pick by intent

Read the matching file before acting; each contains the step-by-step process.

| Intent | File |
| --- | --- |
| Common rules (read first, always applies) | [references/workflow-common-rules.md](references/workflow-common-rules.md) |
| Add a new feature or modify an existing one | [references/workflow-feature.md](references/workflow-feature.md) |
| Fix a bug whose cause is already clear | [references/workflow-fix.md](references/workflow-fix.md) |
| Investigate a bug whose cause is unknown (no fixes, logging only) | [references/workflow-debug.md](references/workflow-debug.md) |
| Improve structure without changing behavior | [references/workflow-refactor.md](references/workflow-refactor.md) |
| Create or update unit tests | [references/workflow-test.md](references/workflow-test.md) |
| Explain how a feature, function, or file works | [references/workflow-explain.md](references/workflow-explain.md) |
| Answer a general question (no code changes) | [references/workflow-ask.md](references/workflow-ask.md) |
| Stage and commit changes (Conventional Commits) | [references/workflow-commit.md](references/workflow-commit.md) |
| Create and push a release tag | [references/workflow-release.md](references/workflow-release.md) |

If no workflow matches, ask the user which they intend, and apply the common
rules + Tauri conventions below.

## Tauri architecture knowledge

Read the relevant file before writing backend/IPC code. These document
recommended, opinionated conventions for Tauri v2 apps; each links to a complete
example under `assets/`.

| Topic | File |
| --- | --- |
| Adding/changing a command (Rust → bindings → frontend) | [references/tauri-command-flow.md](references/tauri-command-flow.md) |
| Backend feature layout (models→repository→service→commands) | [references/tauri-feature-module-anatomy.md](references/tauri-feature-module-anatomy.md) |
| Shared state (state container, Arc, manage, std vs tokio Mutex) | [references/tauri-state-management.md](references/tauri-state-management.md) |
| Error convention (`AppError`, `[Category] message`, full-stack) | [references/tauri-error-handling.md](references/tauri-error-handling.md) |
| Backend→frontend events (typed payloads, Emitter structs) | [references/tauri-events-and-emitters.md](references/tauri-events-and-emitters.md) |
| Database (rusqlite, connection-per-op, in-place migrations) | [references/tauri-database-conventions.md](references/tauri-database-conventions.md) |
| Frontend data layer (RTK Query over Tauri, tags, streaming) | [references/tauri-frontend-data-layer.md](references/tauri-frontend-data-layer.md) |
| Capabilities/permissions, plugins, config & versioning | [references/tauri-capabilities-and-config.md](references/tauri-capabilities-and-config.md) |

Complete example sources are in [assets/](assets/) — see
[assets/README.md](assets/README.md) for the map.
